# Hello! I'm Allex

I'm a passionate developer specializing in Python, but I also do Javascript, Java and *a bit* of HTML.

## What I Do

### Discord Bot Development
I create Python and Javascript discord bots from scratch, with designing

### Automation and Scripting
I love automatizating tasks, since we are all lazy!

### Collaboration and Open Source
I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects and contributing to the open-source community.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Js, lua
- **Main Libraries:** py-cord, discord.js
- **Second libraries (less experienced):** OpenCV, yt_dlp, discord.py

## Projects

Here are a few of my projects:

### Nyasuki
I've done many bots in the past but I think this one is far more better and efficient, I even used AI. Currently remaking it into full AI

### Nyanko
This is the newest discord bot I am making (as of 2024-10-20), it includes minigames

### [File Compressor](https://github.com/Alleexx129/compressfiles)
This was a library to test out the features of PyPi libraries! You can download it using:

```sh
pip install compressfiles
```

### Anime girl API
This is a 100% manual library to get anime girl images, it includes currently ~500 images more info at https://www.catgirlnexus.xyz/api/documentation/
