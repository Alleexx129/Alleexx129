## Projects

Here are a few of my projects:

### Nyasuki
I've done many bots in the past but I think this one is far more better and efficient, I even used AI.

### [File Compressor](https://github.com/Alleexx129/compressfiles)
This was a library to test out the features of PyPi libraries! You can download it using:
