I'm a passionate developer specializing in creating innovative and efficient Discord bots. With a knack for solving problems and automating tasks, I enjoy turning ideas into reality through code.

What I Do:

Automation and Scripting: I love automating repetitive tasks and creating scripts that save time and effort.
Collaboration and Open Source: I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects and contributing to the open-source community.
Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Frameworks and Libraries: discord.py, py-cord
Tools and Platforms: GitHub, discord
Projects
Here are a few of my projects:

Nyasuki: I've done many bots in the past but I think this one is far more better and efficient, I even used AI
file compressor: This was a project to test out how I could make a public library! You can download it using ```pip install compressfiles```
You can find more of my work on my GitHub profile.

Let's Collaborate!
I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. If you have an exciting project or idea and think we could make something great together, feel free to reach out! Whether it's developing a new bot, improving an existing one, or exploring new technologies, I'm excited to collaborate and create something amazing.
